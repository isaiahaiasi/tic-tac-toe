# TIC TAC TOE

Another *vintage* Odin Project project. This project follows a series of lessons aimed at teaching various different types of scoping and dealing with objects: constructors, factories, classes, modules, and functional modules. The goal here is to create a program with a very modular structure, with minimal coupling or global state.

## Pub Sub üç∫
I opted to implement a ground-up Event system for this project. I realize that this project (or at least *my* version of this project) doesn't really merit such an elaborate system, but I really wanted to get better acquainted with the pub-sub pattern, and start learning where it could be implemented in order to decouple my modules. 

I didn't reference a pre-written implementation, because I treated it as its own mini-challenge. After completing this project, I will look more closely at existing Event system implementations, and will hopefully have a really good framework for understanding why they made different decisions than I did, based on what worked and didn't work with my own system.

## Modularization & Decoupling üîó
I've been so excited having the ability to encapsulate, namespace, and add private properties to my code, that I might have gone a little module-crazy. I tried to keep as much functionality as possible contained within its own module, only exposing a few methods or variables. 

- **Events module** - Fully agnostic of the rest of the code, so I could theoretically just drop it into future projects, which is exciting! (Even though I should probably just use a prebuilt version, which no doubt better accounts for edge cases and is probably less verbose).
- **GameFlow module** - The managing module. I tried to limit my tight coupling to this module (for example, directly calling other modules' init() functions).
- **GameBoard module** - Holds the state of the board, checking valid positions, and checking for win conditions.
- **View Module** - I tried to make sure my DOM manipulation was decoupled from my game logic, so this module is just a small collection of utility classes for all the other modules that are responsible for directly interfacing with the DOM. My goal was to minimize repetitive code (eg, finding a button and adding an onclick function, copying html from a template, etc).
- **Specific View Modules** - Each particular "view" component (eg, start menu view, board view, etc) gets its own module. I implemented these as IIFEs, but a better solution would have probably been to have them be factories. The reason being, each of these contain their own unique "stateful" information, and currently if I want to, eg, reset the state of the game, I have to track all this state information and reset it manually. It would be far more elegant to just create and dispose of these objects as necessary.

## Minimax ‚ôú
Trying to be clever bit me again. Before even beginning on the minimax implementation, I had to remove 80 lines of cruft, because I used a lengthy generic "check win" algorithm. The advantage of this method was it would work for any size board square (so you could have, say, a 7x7 board).

Implementing minimax also helped me understand why people sometimes call the "singleton" pattern a code smell. I had set up my GameBoard module, effectively, as a singleton--you could only have one instance of it, and that instance had particular state info about the board. I thought this would be fine, but minimax required running through hundreds of possible board outcomes, and it didn't make sense to try to mutate the True board's data and reset it throughout all those variations. If I had pushed myself to only use modules when I logically *couldn't* have more than one instance, rather than when I assumed I wouldn't *want* more than one instance, I could have avoided refactoring that section of code.

## Refactoring with ES Modules
The lesson after this covers webpack and splitting code up using es6 modules. To try to get a better understanding of the process, I refactored this project using these new tools. It was mostly straightforward, but again it helped highlight some of my myopic organization. Even though I tried to keep my concerns separated, I didn't always keep true to that rule, and there were a handful of dependencies that I needed to refactor away through dependency injection. It's still not perfect, but the process definitely gave me a better idea of things to watch out for in the future.
