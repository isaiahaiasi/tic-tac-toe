# TIC TAC TOE

Another *vintage* Odin Project project. This project follows a series of lessons aimed at teaching various different types of scoping and dealing with objects: constructors, factories, classes, modules, and functional modules. The goal here is to create a program with a very modular structure, without minimal coupling or global state.

## Pub Sub üç∫
I opted to implement a ground-up Event system for this project. I realize that this project (or at least *my* version of this project) don't really merit such an elaborate system, but I really wanted to get better acquainted with the pub-sub pattern, and start learning where it could be implemented in order to decouple my modules. 

I didn't reference a pre-written implementation, because I treated it as its own mini-challenge. After completing this project, I will look more closely at existing Event system implementations, and will hopefully have a really good framework for understanding why they made different decisions than I did, based on what worked and didn't work with my own system.
